Perfect for editing regular expressions, multi line texts, inline HTML and many more use cases. Also provides quick feedback on string length.

## Installation

**Compatible with Xcode 5.1**

There are two ways:

1. Build the Xcode project and restart Xcode. The plugin will automatically be installed in `~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins`. First remove the plugin from there (and restart Xcode).

   If you get a "Permission Denied" error while building, please see [this issue](https://github.com/omz/ColorSense-for-Xcode/issues/1).

1. Use [**Alcatraz**, the package manager for Xcode](http://alcatraz.io/) (Attention, you'll need to have MacOS 10.9 installed!)

## Keyboard Shortcut

With a little trick you can enable keyboard shortcut for showing the popover. Open `System Preferences` app, then section `Keyboard` and add a custom application shortcut for Xcode as in the following image:
